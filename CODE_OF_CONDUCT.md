# Code of Conduct

This project uses a slightly modified version of the Contributor Covenant.
The goal is simple: don’t be a jerk.

## The short version

- Be respectful.
- Assume good intent.
- Argue about code, not people.
- If someone asks you to stop, stop.

That’s it.

## The longer version (for completeness)

Participation in this project should be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience.

Unacceptable behavior includes (but is not limited to):

- Harassment, intimidation, or threats
- Personal attacks or insults
- Publishing someone else’s private information
- Deliberate disruption of discussions
- Anything that would get you thrown out of a normal workplace

Maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions, comments, or issues that violate this code of conduct.

## Scope

This applies to:

- Issues
- Pull requests
- Discussions
- Any other project space where you interact with this repository

## Enforcement

If something crosses the line, maintainers will use their best judgment.
This may include:

- Asking you to knock it off
- Closing issues or PRs
- Blocking participation

If you believe someone is acting in bad faith or violating this code, open an issue or contact the maintainer privately as described in `SECURITY.md`.

## Attribution

This is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 2.1,
with most of the corporate fluff removed.
