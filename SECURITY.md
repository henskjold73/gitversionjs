# Security Policy

## Short version

If you find a security issue, don’t drop it in a public issue and act surprised when it goes badly.

## Supported versions

Only the latest published version is supported with security fixes.  
Older versions may still work, but they are not maintained.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do NOT open a public GitHub issue** for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use one of the following:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**  
   Repository → Security → Advisories → Report a vulnerability  
   This keeps the discussion private and is the preferred option.

2. If that is not possible, open a minimal issue asking for a private
   contact channel. Do not include exploit details in the issue itself.

## What to include

Please include enough information to understand and reproduce the issue:

- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce (or a minimal proof of concept)
- What the realistic impact is
- Any suggested fix, if you have one

You do not need to write a novel.  
You do need to include something actionable.

## Response expectations

This is a small project.

Reports will be acknowledged when seen and handled as time permits.  
There is no guaranteed SLA, but good-faith reports will not be ignored.

## Final note

If you are unsure whether something counts as a security issue:

- err on the side of caution
- report it privately
- let the maintainer decide

Dropping exploits in public issues is a fast way to get ignored.
